# ServerStarter
A simple python program that allows people who don't know java syntax to start a Minecraft server. It even has a GUI! Choose the amount of
ram you would like to allocate the server jar with and then choose the server jar. Simple and easy! Feel free to modify the program in the terms of the LICENSE file, however I will only give support on the original file shown here and I reserve the right to not give support at my own discretion in terms of the LICENSE file, and any modified copies of this file must be shipped with this LICENSE by law.
